;;; Commentary:

;; Configurations for making Emacs and Amalthea a better looking editor,
;; something that Emacs sorely needs, because it's pretty damn ugly by default.

;;; Code:

(defvar amalthea-mono-font "Iosevka"
  "The default monospaced font that Amalthea uses.")

(defvar amalthea-serif-font "Iosevka"
  "The default sans serif font that Amalthea uses.")

(defvar amalthea-line-spacing 0.15
  "The default line spacing width that Amalthea uses.")

(defvar amalthea-font-size 140
  "The default font size for Amalthea.")

;;; Fonts

(set-face-attribute 'default nil
		                :family amalthea-mono-font
		                :height amalthea-font-size)
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil
		                :family amalthea-serif-font
		                :height amalthea-font-size)
(set-frame-font amalthea-mono-font nil t)

;;; General UI settings:

;; Starting with Emacs 26.1, Emacs has a built-in line number mode written in C
;; that supports relative line numbers, like in Vim. This is awesome, because
;; the previous offerings had a whole bunch of drawbacks, either being really
;; slow, or not properly supporting relative line numbers in Org mode and so on.
;; Thankfully we now have a proper solution.

;; First, we set the relative line number to `visual', which counts the visible
;; lines on the screen. Otherwise headers that are folded in Org makes the line
;; count go haywire, next we set a default width for line numbers and ensure
;; that it doesn't get narrower or wider depending on the amount of lines in a
;; file.

;; Finally, we disable the visible and audible bell that is enabled by default
;; because it's bloody annoying.
(setq-default line-spacing amalthea-line-spacing      ;; Give lines some breathing room
              frame-title-format '("Amalthea :: %b")  ;; Name the Emacs window
              display-line-numbers 'visual            ;; Count the visible line numbers, not the actual number
              display-line-numbers-current-absolute t ;; Show line number of current line instead of 0
              display-line-numbers-width 4            ;; Enough space for huge files
              display-line-numbers-widen nil          ;; Disable dynamic sizing of line number width
              visible-bell nil                        ;; No bells
              ring-bell-function #'ignore)            ;; NO BELLS

;;; `hl-line':
;; This is basically something that I learned to use and love from Vim, it
;; highlights the current line where the cursor is currently active. We enable
;; this minor mode globally, and then make it so it doesn't display in inactive
;; windows.
(use-package hl-line
  :commands (global-hl-line-mode)
  :init (global-hl-line-mode)
  :config
  (setq global-hl-line-sticky-flag nil)) ;; Don't highlight current line in inactive buffers

(provide 'core-ui)
